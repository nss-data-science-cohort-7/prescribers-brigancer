--		âœ…b. Which drug (generic_name) has the hightest total cost per day? Bonus: Round your cost per day column to 2 decimal places. Google ROUND to see how this works.

-- SELECT ROUND(pn.total_drug_cost/pn.total_day_supply, 2) as daily_drug_cost, pn.drug_name, d.generic_name

--		âœ…a. For each drug in the drug table, return the drug name and then a column named 'drug_type' which says 'opioid' for drugs which have opioid_drug_flag = 'Y', says 'antibiotic' for those drugs which have antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y', and says 'neither' for all other drugs.

-- SELECT drug_name,
-- 	CASE WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'opioid'
-- 	WHEN antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'antibiotic'
-- 	ELSE 'neither' END AS drug_type
-- FROM drug;

--		âœ…b. Building off of the query you wrote for part a, determine whether more was spent (total_drug_cost) on opioids or on antibiotics. Hint: Format the total costs as MONEY for easier comparision.

-- SELECT 
-- 	CASE WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'opioid'
-- 	WHEN antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'antibiotic'
-- 	ELSE 'neither' END AS drug_type,
-- 	SUM(p.total_drug_cost) AS money

-- LEFT JOIN prescription AS p
-- ON d.drug_name=p.drug_name
-- GROUP BY drug_type;

		--ðŸ’»The total amount spent on opioids was $105,080,626.37. By comparison only $38,435,121.26 was spent on antibiotics.

-- WHERE fi.state='TN';

		--ðŸ’»There are 10 CBSA's in Tennessee.
		
--		âœ…b. Which cbsa has the largest combined population? Which has the smallest? Report the CBSA name and total population.

--		âœ…a. Find all rows in the prescription table where total_claims is at least 3000. Report the drug_name and the total_claim_count.

SELECT drug_name, SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims
FROM prescription
GROUP BY drug_name
HAVING SUM(total_claim_count)>=3000
ORDER BY total_claims DESC;

		--ðŸ’»507 drugs total at least 3000 claims

--		âœ…b. For each instance that you found in part a, add a column that indicates whether the drug is an opioid.

SELECT p.drug_name, SUM(p.total_claim_count) AS total_claims,
	CASE WHEN d.opioid_drug_flag='Y' THEN 'opioid'
	ELSE '' END AS opioid
FROM prescription as p
RIGHT JOIN drug as d
ON p.drug_name=d.drug_name
GROUP BY p.drug_name, opioid
HAVING SUM(total_claim_count)>=3000
ORDER BY opioid DESC, total_claims DESC;

		--ðŸ’»17 of the drugs with at least 3000 claims are opioids
		
--		c. Add another column to you answer from the previous part which gives the prescriber first and last name associated with each row.

--	The goal of this exercise is to generate a full list of all pain management specialists in Nashville and the number of claims they had for each opioid. Hint: The results from all 3 parts will have 637 rows.

--		a. First, create a list of all npi/drug_name combinations for pain management specialists (specialty_description = 'Pain Management) in the city of Nashville (nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'), where the drug is an opioid (opiod_drug_flag = 'Y'). Warning: Double-check your query before running it. You will only need to use the prescriber and drug tables since you don't need the claims numbers yet.



--		b. Next, report the number of claims per drug per prescriber. Be sure to include all combinations, whether or not the prescriber had any claims. You should report the npi, the drug name, and the number of claims (total_claim_count).



--		c. Finally, if you have not done so already, fill in any missing values for total_claim_count with 0. Hint - Google the COALESCE function.
